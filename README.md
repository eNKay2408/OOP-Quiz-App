# OOP Quiz App

This was my first self-initiated project on my web development journey, and I was thrilled to successfully deploy it using GitHub Pages. The project was created to prepare for a seminar presentation on the Decorator Pattern for my second-year OOP course.

I still vividly remember that night, I coded non-stop from 9 PM to 5 AM, racing against the clock to prepare for our 7 AM presentation. After that, I only managed to squeeze in 1 hour and 30 minutes of sleep before rushing to class to present with my team.

Luckily, our presentation went exceptionally well that day, leaving a strong impression on both the professor and our classmates. We were all incredibly proud of ourselves and even took a memorable photo with our professor, haha. This remains one of my fondest university memories âœ¨.

*Here are some screenshots of the project showcasing its features and design:*
